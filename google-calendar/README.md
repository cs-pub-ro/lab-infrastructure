Use the `create_calendar_events.py` script to create events in Google Calendar. The scripts is based on [Google's python-samples](https://github.com/gsuitedevs/python-samples/tree/master/drive/quickstart),
[Google's calendar example](https://developers.google.com/calendar/create-events) and [Google's Calendar API doc](http://googleapis.github.io/google-api-python-client/docs/dyn/calendar_v3.events.html#insert).

First you need to enabled Google Drive API, as shown [here](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/enable-drive-api). Then download the `credentials.json` file and place it here.
