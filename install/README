The script install-apt-packages.bash takes as arguments packages files,
containing the apt packages it should install.

".packages" files format:
 - each line contains the name of a single package that should be passed to apt
 - blank lines are allowed
 - lines beginning with a "#" are considered comments and are ignored
 - other ".packages" file can be included on a line beginning with "+"* (no
spaces after it). E.g. if "a.packages" wants to include "b.packages" it should
contain a line "+b.packages"

* I assumed an apt package's name can't start with "*"; if it can, tough luck...
