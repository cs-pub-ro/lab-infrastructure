Use the `create_gdrive_structure.py` script to create a Google Drive structure for a class. The scripts is based on [Google's python-samples](https://github.com/gsuitedevs/python-samples/tree/master/drive/quickstart).

First you need to enabled Google Drive API, as shown [here](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/enable-drive-api). Then download the `credentials.json` file and place it here.

The best way is to run the script in a virtual environment, using `virtualenv`. [Here](https://medium.com/@shivama205/google-drive-api-playing-around-dbffe544c574) is a summary on setting up the environment.
